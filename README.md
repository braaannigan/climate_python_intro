# Introduction to python for climate scientists
The material here is aimed to climate scientists who work with data in netcdf files.
The aim of is to show that you can use python to carry out your analysis
in a way that:
* scales better to large datasets
* is easier to write
* and is easier to read.

# Installation instructions
The installation instructions are XXX

If you have used matlab or R or whatever before you should be able to follow
the material.  The materials are written in interactive jupyter notebooks
and so you can just play around with the existing code.  There are links
throughout to other material that I've found helpful for learning
the basics.

At the end of this tutorial you **will not** be an expert programmer.  
Instead the point is to alert you to the fact that packages
exist that provide good solutions for many of the problems you face in your analysis workflow.
Using these packages will allow you to spend more time thinking about the
scientific problems that you really want to focus on.

Finally, remember that these packages are open source and
have all been written by a community of people like you who started out making baby steps
themselves.  In time, if you come across a bug in the software take that as
 a chance to get involved and contribute back to the community.
