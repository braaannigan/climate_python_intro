# Better analysis with python

*Liam Brannigan (with help from Lucy Tallents)*

MISU, December 2017
---
# Key concepts
- Much easier to write good code with **labelled** data
- Analysing in **parallel** need not be complicated
- **Just in time** compilation may save you a lot of time
---
# Things we *will* do today
- See how these concepts work in practice
- Look at some realistic examples

# Things we will *not* do today
- Go into much detail
---
# Objectives
You will:
- be able to take advantage of major recent advances in analysis software
- have a set of materials that you can use for practice to get yourself going

You will not be able to:
- use these packages like an expert

**Focus on the key concepts, not the details of the code**.

---
# Plan
1. Pandas and labelled data
2. Going parallel with dask
3. Labels and parallel for netcdf files with xarray
4. Compiling with numba
